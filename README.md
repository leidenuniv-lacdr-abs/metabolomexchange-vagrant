Getting started
=========================

**Install Vagrant and Virtualbox**

- Vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
- Virtualbox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Once installed you go to the directory with the Vagrantfile and run:

```
vagrant up
```

After about 3 minutes you should have a running version of MetabolomeXchange at http://localhost:5000
